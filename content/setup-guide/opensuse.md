### optional packages

#### gamescope
Isolates game from system display server, no desktop res changing when in use. As well as forcing games into fullscreen and scaling when necessary. Can provide AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution or NVIDIA Image Scaling support.

```sh
sudo zypper install opi
#when running opi, install from home:VortexAcherontic:Nightly
opi gamescope
```

- NVIDIA drivers may have some issues with this.
- Requires **full** Vulkan support. (old architectures with none or semi are not compatible)
- May cause failure to run from first try in certain cases.
- Is not always used by scripts, testing is done to confirm that it is compatible.
